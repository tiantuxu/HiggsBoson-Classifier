# CS57800 Project
## SVM-Classifier
Higgs Boson Machine Learning Kaggle Challenge

## Dataset URL
https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson/data

## Algorithm
RBF Kernal SVM

## Cross-validation
Few rounds of (60%, 20%, 20%) data shuffle.

## Result
1. Heatmap of hyperparameter choices (C, Beta)
2. Individual study of C or Beta on overfitting
